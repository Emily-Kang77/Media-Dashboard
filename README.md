# The Idea

There's several websites and apps that I go to for entertainment, like YouTube for videos or Spotify for podcasts. But they can often distract me from the content that I've subscribed to and I know that I enjoy. So I want this app to be a one-stop-shop where it's really easy to add podcasts, YouTube channels, or other media, and add ratings and categories for them. So I click one of the links and it directs me to the app/webpage I want to be at!

# MVP

- Use a podcast API to easily search new podcasts and add them, with metadata automatically filled in
- Add user authentication
- Make a homepage, folders

# Later

- Add recommendations from your existing media with a query like "I want to watch something educational" or "Give me something funny".
